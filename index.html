Hey! Do you like monkeys?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-UbHw8eDzM">These are some very
happy monkeys!</a>

<h1>Monkeys</h1>

<p>Monkeys are some of the greatest, if not the greatest creatures to
ever roam this planet. Humans evolved from monkeys' ancestors, they are
also our ancestors, so that makes us and monkeys related, by very distant
relatives. Monkeys created the banana, the banana is a fruit, and a very,
very deadly weapon. The banana was originally created by monkeys to eat,
then they used it to kill...they went to war.</p>

<h2>WAR AMONGST MONKEYS!</h2>

<p>The monkeys had went to war over who should be considered a monkey,
those who live in the jungle or all monkeys. The monkeys who lived in the
jungle were being disrespected by the other monkeys and had their banana
privilleges revoked by the monkeys who disliked the jungle monkeys.
The jungle monkeys were devising a plan to break free of the mean monkeys
clutches when, the good liberator monkeys broke through and saved all of
the jungle monkeys.</p>

<h3>Jungle Monkeys and Liberator Monkeys</h3>

<p>The liberator monkeys were the good monkeys who loved all monkeys and,
thought that the jungle monkeys needed their banana privellges back,
and believed that all monkeys are equal and monkeys are monkeys.
Except for apes, Gorillas, Orangutangs and any other apes are monkeys
immortal enemy. Monkeys will forever hate the apes and be at war with
them for copying them (monkeys were the OG's).</p>

<h4>apes...ugh</h4>

<p>Apes suck, monkeys are better, monkeys have tails, some monkeys have
red butts, some monkeys faces look like they are face painted and,
monkeys will someday take over the world. Monkeys also never got a movie
explaining how they would take over the world, and then have that movie
get a remake that looks very similar to the original and then get another
remake of that original movie that looks nothing like either of the
previous two movies and then have that movie get two more sequels about
how the apes took over and went to war with the humans and eventually
went on to nearly go exctinct and then be at piece with humans.</p>

<h5>Planet of the Apes</h5>

<p>What else is there to say? I just spoiled the ending of the third movie
in the new trilogy, they are good movies, i prefer the Mark Wahlberg one,
but hey at least Godzilla vs Kong got a good remake. I wish there was a
giant atomic lizard in the new Planet of the Apes, it would have made it
a lot better, it would even have been better if there was a Giant Atomic
Monkey.</p>

<h6>Giant Atomic Monkey! G.A.M</h6>

<p>A Giant Atomic Monkey is a weapon of mass destruction and banana-scented
radiation that can kill you, if you inhale too much, at one time. I
smell a really nice banana scent right now and i can't tell if it's my
air freshener or someone's cooking bu...</p>

<title>Big Boy Monkeys</title>

<p>Big Boy Monkeys are monkeys who have grown up and reached the age to
be called Big Boy Monkeys. Being a Big Boy Monkey, you have to, help in
the, production of bananas, help watch baby monkeys, eliminate enemies,
for example: Gorillas, Orangutangs, and Humans. There can only be one
furry primate, and it is monkeys.</p>
